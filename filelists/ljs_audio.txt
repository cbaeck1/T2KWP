LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0001.wav|Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0002.wav|in being comparatively modern.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0003.wav|For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0004.wav|produced the block books, which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0005.wav|the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0006.wav|And it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of fine typography,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0007.wav|the earliest book printed with movable types, the Gutenberg, or forty-two line Bible of about 1455,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0008.wav|has never been surpassed.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0009.wav|Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0010.wav|Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0011.wav|it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0012.wav|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0013.wav|than in the same operations with ugly ones.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0014.wav|And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0015.wav|the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0016.wav|The Middle Ages brought calligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0017.wav|that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character, and they followed them very closely.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0018.wav|The first books were printed in black letter, i.e. the letter which was a Gothic development of the ancient Roman character,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0019.wav|and which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the lower-case than the capital letters;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0020.wav|the lower-case being in fact invented in the early Middle Ages.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0021.wav|The earliest book printed with movable type, the aforesaid Gutenberg Bible, is printed in letters which are an exact imitation
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0022.wav|of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time; this has since been called missal type,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0023.wav|and was in fact the kind of letter used in the many splendid missals, psalters, etc., produced by printing in the fifteenth century.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0024.wav|But the first Bible actually dated (which also was printed at Maintz by Peter Schoeffer in the year 1462)
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0025.wav|imitates a much freer hand, simpler, rounder, and less spiky, and therefore far pleasanter and easier to read.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0026.wav|On the whole the type of this book may be considered the ne-plus-ultra of Gothic type,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0027.wav|especially as regards the lower-case letters; and type very similar was used during the next fifteen or twenty years not only by Schoeffer,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0028.wav|but by printers in Strasburg, Basle, Paris, Lubeck, and other cities.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0029.wav|But though on the whole, except in Italy, Gothic letter was most often used
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0030.wav|a very few years saw the birth of Roman character not only in Italy, but in Germany and France.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0031.wav|In 1465 Sweynheim and Pannartz began printing in the monastery of Subiaco near Rome,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0032.wav|and used an exceedingly beautiful type, which is indeed to look at a transition between Gothic and Roman,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0033.wav|but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century MSS.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0034.wav|They printed very few books in this type, three only; but in their very first books in Rome, beginning with the year 1468,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0035.wav|they discarded this for a more completely Roman and far less beautiful letter.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0036.wav|But about the same year Mentelin at Strasburg began to print in a type which is distinctly Roman;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0037.wav|and the next year Gunther Zeiner at Augsburg followed suit;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0038.wav|while in 1470 at Paris Udalric Gering and his associates turned out the first books printed in France, also in Roman character.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0039.wav|The Roman type of all these printers is similar in character,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0040.wav|and is very simple and legible, and unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by no means without beauty.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0041.wav|It must be said that it is in no way like the transition type of Subiaco,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0042.wav|and though more Roman than that, yet scarcely more like the complete Roman type of the earliest printers of Rome.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0043.wav|A further development of the Roman letter took place at Venice.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0044.wav|John of Spires and his brother Vindelin, followed by Nicholas Jenson, began to print in that city,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0045.wav|1469, 1470;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0046.wav|their type is on the lines of the German and French rather than of the Roman printers.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0047.wav|Of Jenson it must be said that he carried the development of Roman type as far as it can go:
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0048.wav|his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least as beautiful as any other Roman type.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0049.wav|After his death in the fourteen eighties, or at least by 1490, printing in Venice had declined very much;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0050.wav|and though the famous family of Aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered letters,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0051.wav|and paying great attention to the press work or actual process of printing,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0052.wav|yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than Jenson's, and in fact
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0053.wav|they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0054.wav|Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0055.wav|some of which -- as, e.g., that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge -- is scarcely distinguishable from his.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0056.wav|It was these great Venetian printers, together with their brethren of Rome, Milan,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0057.wav|Parma, and one or two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the Classics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0058.wav|and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch. By far,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0059.wav|the greater part of these Italian printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0060.wav|It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0061.wav|the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0062.wav|Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0063.wav|which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0064.wav|many of whose types, indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a transitional character.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0065.wav|This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0066.wav|In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0067.wav|In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, Gothic was the favorite.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0068.wav|The characteristic Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0069.wav|This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0070.wav|and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0071.wav|Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0072.wav|After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0073.wav|went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0074.wav|the best, mostly French or Low-Country, was neat and clear, but without any distinction;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0075.wav|the worst, which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0076.wav|and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0077.wav|In England about this time, an attempt was made (notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-founder in 1720)
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0078.wav|to improve the letter in form.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0079.wav|Caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0080.wav|he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0081.wav|type cast from his matrices is still in everyday use.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0082.wav|In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0083.wav|The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0084.wav|But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0085.wav|It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0086.wav|are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0087.wav|for the seventeenth-century letters are at least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman, Didot,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0088.wav|were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0089.wav|but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0090.wav|With this change the art of printing touched bottom,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0091.wav|so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about 1840.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0092.wav|The Chiswick press in 1844 revived Caslon's founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0093.wav|This experiment was so far successful that about 1850 Messrs. Miller and Richard of Edinburgh
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0094.wav|were induced to cut punches for a series of old style letters.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0095.wav|These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0096.wav|have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary modern style in use in England, which is in fact the Bodoni type
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0097.wav|a little reduced in ugliness. The design of the letters of this modern old style leaves a good deal to be desired,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0098.wav|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0099.wav|It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0100.wav|and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.
